A production-ready authentication microservice following clean architecture principles with Express 5, Drizzle ORM, and Neon serverless PostgreSQL. It implements secure authentication patterns (bcrypt + JWT), input validation (Zod), structured logging (Winston), and follows modern JavaScript practices with ES modules and subpath imports. The codebase is well-organized into routes → controllers → services → models layers, making it maintainable and testable, though it currently needs completion of sign-in/sign-out flows and authentication middleware for protected routes.
